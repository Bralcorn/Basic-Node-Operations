Questions

1. The sort command sorts the input and then outputs it. The wc command outputs the
number of newlines, words, and bytes. The uniq commands gets rid of any duplicate lines
and then returns the result.

2. The commad I used was "sort commands.js | uniq | wc". This command sorted the data,
in commands.js, then it removed any adjacent duplicates, and lastly it returned the
number of newlines, words, and bytes.

6. Reverse String Challenge

function reverseString(inputString) {
  splitString = inputString.split(" ");
  reSplitString = [];
  splitString.forEach((word) => {
    reSplitString.push(word.split('').reverse().join(''));
  });
  return reSplitString.join(" ");
}
